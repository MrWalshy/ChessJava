What is chess?
	- Chess is a two player strategy board game.
	- Chess is played on a chequered board.
	- The board is 64 squares in an 8x8 grid.
	- Each player begins with 16 pieces.
	- Chess board is arranged by 'Ranks' and 'Files'.
		- A 'rank' is a row labelled from '1' to '8'.
		- A 'file' is a column labelled from 'A' to 'H'.

What are the pieces?
	- Each player has 1 King.
	- Each player has 1 Queen.
	- Each player has 2 Bishops.
	- Each player has 2 Knights.
	- Each player has 2 Rooks.
	- Each player has 8 Pawns.
	
How does each piece move?
	- A King can: 
		- Travel 1 square in any direction.
		- Special move: Castling (Involves the Rook).
		
	- The Queen can:
		- Move any number of squares on a file, rank or
		  diagonally.
		- NOT leap over other pieces.
		
	- The Bishop can:
		- Only move diagonally, any number of squares.
		- NOT leap over other pieces.
		
	- The Knight can:
		- A Knight can move to only the closest squares that
		  are not on the same rank, file or diagonal (L-Shape).
			- i.e. two squares vertically and one horizontally
			  or two squares horizontally and one vertically.
		- Leap over other pieces.
	
	- A Rook can:
		- Move any number of squares on a file or rank.
		- Can NOT move diagonally.
		- Can NOT leap over other pieces.
		- Special move: Castling (Involves the King).
		
	- A Pawn can:
		- Move forward only 1 square at a time unless it is
		  its first move, then it can move 2 squares.
		- A Pawn can also capture an opponent's piece on a
		  square directly diagonal, in front of the Pawn.
		- Two special moves:
			- En Passant capture.
			- Promotion.
			
Special Moves?
	- Castling
		- Once per game, a King and Rook can make this 
		  special move.
		- King moves two squares along rank 1 towards a Rook,
		  the Rook is placed on the square the King has just
		  passed.
		- Requires the following conditions to be met:
			- Neither the King nor Rook has moved in the game.
			- No pieces between the King and the Rook.
			- King can NOT be in check.
			- King can NOT pass through any square under attack.
			- King can NOT move to a square that would result
			  in check.
			- Castling is permitted if the Rook is under attack
			  or crossing an attacked square.
			  
	- En Passant
		- Involves the Pawn.
		- Can only occur if a Pawn makes its first move
		  of 2 squares from its starting square, and if it
		  could have been captured by an enemy Pawn if it
		  advanced only one square.
		- COME BACK TO THIS ONE LATER!
		
	- Promotion
		- If a Pawn reaches the 8th rank from its side, it is
		  promoted and must be exchanged for either one of the
		  following:
		  	- Queen
		  	- Rook
		  	- Bishop
		  	- Knight
		- Underpromotion occurs if the Pawn is not promoted to
		  a queen.
		  
What is Check?
	- A players King is in Check if it is under attack from
	  one or two of the opponent's pieces.
	- The player in Check can only make a legal move that
	  results in the players King no longer being in check.
	- Ways of getting out of check include:
		- Capturing the attacking piece.
		- Interposing a piece only if the attacking piece is
		  a Queen, Rook or Bishop with at least 1 square
		  between the King and the attacking piece.
		- Moving the King to a square where it is not in check.

Win conditions:
	- Checkmate: Player whose turn it is has no legal moves
				 left.
	- Resignation: Either player may resign, conceding the
				   victory.
	- Forfeit: Cheats, conduct violators and rule violators
			   can be forfeited.

What are the rules?
	- Rules are published by FIDE (Federation Internationale
	  des Echechs).
	- Chess is divided into white and black sets.
	- Each set consists of the 16 pieces aforementioned.
	- Played on Ranks and Files as aforementioned.
	- Illegal to skip a turn.
	- Can not make a move that would leave the player's own
	  King in check.
	- If a player has no legal move, the game is over.
		- Checkmate is the loss state for a player with no
		  legal move left if the King is in check.
		- Stalemate is a draw if the King is not in check.

		   OVERVIEW

Update as needed...#
#################################################
IN ALL CLASSES, OVERRIDE toString() and equals()#
#################################################

What objects do I need? (Capitalised words are classes)
	- Chessboard.
	- Tile for tiles on Chessboard.
	- Piece.
	- Queen extending Piece, King extending Piece, etc...
	- App to run the code.

What is in the Chessboard class?
	- Instance variables:
		- Tile 2d Array that can store 64 tiles in an 8x8 grid.
		- Boolean blacksTurn, true is blacks turn and false is whites turn
		
	- Constructor to populate the Tile Array.
	
	- Private Instance methods:
		- createPieces() - Return the chess pieces
		- createTiles() - Return the board tiles with chess pieces on
		- populateGrid() - Return an array of boardTiles
		- whoGoesFirst() - Return the player that goes first(true/false)
		- getPlayersMove() - Return the players move
		- checkIfMoveIsLegal() - Return true if the move is legal, else false
		- checkForCheckmate() - Return true if win condition is met, else false
		- checkForDraw() - Return true if draw condition is met, else false
		
What is in the Tile class?
	- Instance variables:
		- tileColour as a string, probably a good idea to look at enums for constants
		- boolean isOccupied, true if the tile is occupied by a piece
		- coordinates int array for the x,y (field, rank) position of the tile
		- Piece object stored as 'piece' if a piece is occupying the tile, else null
		
	- Constructor to populate the instance variables
	
	- Public instance methods:
		- setColour() - Set the tileColour
		- setIsOccupied() - Set the value of isOccupied
		- setPiece() - Set the object referenced by setPiece()
		- getCoords() - Get the coords int array of the current tile
		- getIsOccupied() - Get boolean value of isOccupied
		- getOccupyingPiece() - Get occupying Piece instance if isOccupied is true
		- removeOccupyingPiece() - Removes the occupying piece reference
		
What is in the Piece class?
	- Instance variables:
		- String name, again think about enums(I think they hold constants)
		- String colour, ditto^
		
	- Constructor for instance variables
	
	- setName()
	- setColour()
	- getName()
	- getColour()
